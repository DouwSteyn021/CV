            <p> My name is Douw Steyn and I am from Cape Town, South Africa. I have more than 13 years<br> 
            experience in photography and have a company specialising in interio photography. Furthermore,<br>
            after quiting my 9 - 5 job as an environmental consultant, I started my own company that ensures <br> 
            the protection of Cape Town's beautiful environment during any event or film shoot.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about nature, specifically the ocean, photography gear and anything tech that can help <br>
            me achieve success in life. New developments in the tech world encourages me to educate myself and stay<br>
            up to date with what our modern world has to offer us. For this reason I recently enrolled in a software<br>
            engineering bootcamp to educate myself in a field that has an endless amount of opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>My dream is to work as a software engineer in the avaition field as I am very facinated and interested in <br>
            this industry. I would love to be able to contribute to the aviation sector and see how my work can make a <br>
            difference in an industry that is so vital in our current global climate.
